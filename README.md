# Time-Tracking-Dashboard
An interactive time-tracking dashboard built with CSS Grid and Vanilla JavaScript that dynamically fetches and renders personal activity data from a JSON source across a fully responsive layout.

⏱️ Time Tracking Dashboard
A responsive data dashboard built with a focus on CSS Grid and Dynamic Data Rendering. This project challenges the implementation of a complex, card-based layout that adapts seamlessly across device sizes.

🚀 Key Features
Dynamic Data Switching: Users can toggle between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views, with the dashboard updating stats dynamically using a local JSON data source.

Responsive Grid Layout: Utilized CSS Grid (and Flexbox) to ensure a pixel-perfect match to the design across mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Interactive UI: Includes polished hover states for all interactive cards and navigation elements.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 & CSS3 (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox)

JavaScript (ES6+) (Fetch API, Array Methods)

JSON (Local data handling)

💡 What I Learned
This project was a deep dive into state management at a UI level—specifically how to map through JSON data to update multiple DOM elements simultaneously without a full page reload.
